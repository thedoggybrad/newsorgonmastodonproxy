# NewsOrgOnMastodon Proxy
A proxy for some of the RSS feeds for NewsOrgOnMastodon system of accounts.
<br>
Most of them are proxied because Mastofeed's requests are blocked but some of them are proxied because they do not have their own RSS feeds and it needed some PHP scripts to develop a custom RSS feed.
